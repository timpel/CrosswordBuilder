What
is
the
problem

We
want
to
investigate
whether
Haskell
is
an
effective
tool
for
building
crossword
puzzles
We
will
build
a
program
that
accepts
a
list
of
words
as
input
and
attempts
to
create
and
display
a
crossword
puzzle
built
out
of
those
words
Some
general
algorithms
for
tackling
this
problem
exist
for
example
here
but
will
require
First
wed
like
to
build
more
optimal
crossword
arrangements
This
could
be
done
either
by
1
evaluating
finished
boards
based
on
size
shape
and
number
of
words
and
choosing
the
best
board
obtainable
in
a
fixed
time
/
number
of

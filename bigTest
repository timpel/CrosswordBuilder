Haskell
is
statically
typed
purely
functional
programming
language
with
type
inference
and
lazy
evaluation
Type
classes
which
enable
typesafe
operator
overloading
were
first
proposed
by
Philip
Wadler
and
Stephen
Blott
for
Standard
ML
and
implemented
later
in
Haskell
Its
main
implementation
is
the
Glasgow
Haskell
Compiler
It
is
named
after
logician
Haskell
Curry
Haskell
is
based
on
the
semantics
but
not
the
syntax
of
the
Miranda
programming
language
which
served
to
focus
the
efforts
of
the
initial
Haskell
working
group
The
last
stable
release
was
made
in
July
with
the
next
standard
planned
for
Haskell
is
used
in
academia
and
industry
As
of
September
Haskell
was
the
most
popular
programming
language
in
terms
of
Google
searches
for
tutorials
and
made
up
less
than
of
active
users
on
the
GitHub
source
code
repository
Following
the
release
of
Miranda
by
Research
Software
Ltd
in
interest
in
lazy
functional
languages
grew.
By
more
than
dozen
nonstrict
purely
functional
programming
languages
existed
Miranda
was
the
most
widely
used
but
it
was
proprietary
software
At
the
conference
on
Functional
Programming
Languages
and
Computer
Architecture
in
Portland
Oregon
there
was
strong
consensus
that
committee
be
formed
to
define
an
open
standard
for
such
languages
The
committees
purpose
was
to
consolidate
existing
functional
languages
into
common
one
to
serve
as
basis
for
future
research
in
functionallanguage
design
